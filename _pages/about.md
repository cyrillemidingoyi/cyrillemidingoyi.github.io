I'm responsible of the LIMA platform (Laboratory for Interdisciplinary Modeling of Soil, Crops, and Trees) at CIRAD. My goal is to organize, facilitate, and support the design, construction, operational implementation, and evaluation of technical and scientific performances of soil-crop(-tree) models at CIRAD. With a multidisciplinary background and extensive experience across various fields, I contribute significantly to improving agricultural production and food security in developing countries.

My expertise spans agroclimatology, remote sensing, geomatics, computer science, and agronomy. While I have a keen interest in theory to understand underlying mathematical and physical principles and concepts, my research predominantly focuses on applied aspects. My passion lies in finding tailored solutions to specific challenges within the realms of agronomic and climatic modeling.
